## JS Automated Testing

* Unitary Tests (Just a piece)
* Integrated Tests (A piece interacting with another piece) 
* Functional Tests (The client/user experience)

## Manual testing

* Alpha and Beta
* Acceptance tests
* Prototypes

# TDD (Test Driven Development)

Writing the test before coding, then refactor it later.

Writing the test -> Writing the code -> Refactoring

### Advantages

* Quick Feedback
* Security
* Cleaner Code
* Productivity (Less maintenance)

# BDD (Behavior Driven Development)

Writing the test thinking in the behavior expected and documenting those behaviors.

Just like TDD, the test is writen before the code.

### Advantages

* Sharing knowledge
* Dynamic documentation
* A good project expected behavior
